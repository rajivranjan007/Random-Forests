# Random-Forests
1)
Problem Statement:
A cloth manufacturing company is interested to know about the segment or attributes causes high sale. 
Approach - A Random Forest can be built with target variable Sales (we will first convert it in categorical variable) & all other variable will be independent in the analysis.  
2)
Use Random Forest to prepare a model on fraud data 
treating those who have taxable_income <= 30000 as "Risky" and others are "Good"
